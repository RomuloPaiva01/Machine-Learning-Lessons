# Machine-Learning-Lessons
Lessons created by myself using Jupyter Notebook about Machine Learning.

Soon enough I will translate my code to English as well.

In general, everything here will contain a little bit of modeling/object oriented programming, since most of the tutorials on the internet about Machine Learning use only "random arrays" or "prebuilt datasets" (that is not what you will have if you work with real models).
